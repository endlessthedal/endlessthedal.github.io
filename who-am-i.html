				<p>The Information Age has already led me to leave loads of junks crawling over so many places throughout the cloud via numerous faces and identities. This is an attempt to focus on uniting them as one, reducing the junks, probably. </p>

				<p> So, You wanna know who am I? </p>

				<p>I believe that’s the question which will keep everyone of us alive, searching. Isn’t it? So, A fitting answer would be my entire journey in life. A life that transcends from a dreams of traveling fast, Flying high, Finding another good earth to the dreams of Being happy, Sustainability, Improving quality education, Finding good place in this earth itself, and still dreaming…   </p>

				<p> But to answer, I will try to fit it with some adjectives for the time-being. </p>
