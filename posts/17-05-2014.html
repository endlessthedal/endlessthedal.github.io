		        <p> The Citizens of India,<br>
				You’ve done a great job !<br>
				I hereby congratulate you for the worthwhile work that you’ve done for the past ten years.<br>
				For the ten years of utmost criticism and watchfulness.<br>
				For responsive over any issue that has raised.<br>
				You have been so powerful in throwing out Manmohan Singh.<br>
				You have been skeptical about even any gesture that he has made.<br>
				You have made rudimentary comments about everything that he has spoken, and not even spoken.<br>
				A very much congratulations.<br>
				And, I insist you upon being the same for the forthcoming years also.<br>
				Be bold.<br>
				Be ready with your views.<br>
				Be the watch-men.<br>
				But, but,…<br>
				If you are going to be dumb for anything being done then on, feeling that he will do anything for the best of India and start idolizing him.<br>
				If you are going to speak only what he only does good, and start ignoring his short-comings in course.<br>
				If you are going to be silent, feeling proud that You’ve made a great change with your vote; That you’ve chosen the greatest leader; That you’ve thrown away the corrupt and in place, given the responsibility to the wisest.<br>
				Then, You’re failing miserably.<br>
				You’re failing to be a part of the “powerful” democracy of the world.<br>
				You’re utterly failing to achieve what you’ve aimed at.<br>
				The coming five years are going to be just a test for you.<br>
				Not for anyone else.<br>
				Get Ready </p>
