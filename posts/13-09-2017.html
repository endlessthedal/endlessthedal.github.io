The discovery of America was the foundational event for the Scientific Revolution”<br>– Dr. Yuval Noah Harari

				<p>“You don’t know” is not an unfamiliar phrase. We used to hear that from our childhood, whenever we try to ask or say something out of our own observations about the surroundings, practices and lifestyle. “You don’t know about it. Don’t talk like that.” is what I have always got starting from my mother. And None of them seem so scientific. But here is an historian who says that the courage to say ‘We don’t know’ has led to a better Scientific Revolution.</p>

				<p>Are there two different, ‘I don’t know’?</p>

				<p>Does Science and Religion equally share the same beleif-systems?</p>

				<p>Or these kind of subtle similarities make very religious people to say they are scientific enough too? Or we misunderstood?</p>

				<p>How does I accepting that “I don’t know” take me forward in Science and Religion?</p>

				<p>The scene sets during European voyage to find a new route to Indies (It was originally for Indonesian Archipilego. Don’t get too overwhelmed about India daw, Wealthy nation daaw). Columbus sets out to find some route westward to India, eventually hitting on to American coastline. But He thought it was the India that he set foot on. Even after he returns, he believed in that myth. Many kept that belief too.</p>

				<p>The world map known at that time, contained Eurasia and African continents and few islands here and there. No one could ever dream that such a huge continents can exist or even believe it so. It was Amerigo Vespucci who landed and travelled across America and reported proofs that it is of course a new place and completely different from India. And He was the first one to openly say that, “Yes, We don’t know that such place exists.” And further maps started including the places trailed by him and other explorers. The most notable point is that that maps started leaving out a huge empty space where the present North and South America exists, not filling with any kind of stars, demons or other superstitious mythological drawings. It was left empty.</p>

				<p>Harari says that the emptiness is the symbol of the mankind’s acceptance of their ignorance and that has been a huge step for Science.</p>

				<p>Even spiritual writers say something similar, Accepting our ignorance is what taking us close to omnipresent god.</p>

				<p>Are they meaning same?</p>

				<p>No.</p>

				<p>When I accept ‘I don’t know something’ in Science, I don’t rely on what my beliefs I hold so far about it. I stop keeping prejudices. I start asking questions, do experiments, solve problems, in order that I know something about it.</p>

				<p>But, It is imperative in a Religion that I should accept ‘I don’t know something or even anything’ because someone else knows everything. Sounds awkward to me. We were easily shut by others with this argument, that we are not allowed anymore to even dissent about it because I don’t know. Not only that, But also someone else knows everything. Ridiculous.</p>

				<p>I can accept that I don’t know about Relativity that someone like Einstein had known. But Accepting that means that I can learn from him, or about it, that I can ask questions or doubts about it. Or If found mistake, I could even argue against it.</p>

				<p>Acceptance of “I don’t know” is not the end. It is the beginning of the “I want to know”.</p>

				<p>It is after Amerigo’s acceptance of the ignorance, the whole of Europe started to look out for what is really there, explore, exploit, take home, learn, kill, die, build, grow and much much more.</p>

				<p>What makes one more curious than “You know nothing” </p>
