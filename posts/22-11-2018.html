        <p> Once there was a residential school in a city in which a boy named Thedal was studying in eighth standard. One day, his Physics teacher conducted an objective test on Electromagnetism. All the fifty students in the class wrote the exam and the teacher evaluated their answers and gave them marks and they were ranked from 1 to 50 based on their marks. Since this is their first test that they all are facing in this academic year, the students were really nervous to get to know their marks and ranking. </p>

        <p> One student named A got 100 out of 100 and ranked no. 1 in the class.<br>Another student named E got 13 out of 100 and ranked no. 50 in the class. </p>

        <p> Since both of them are his friends, Thedal went and asked A and E separately about how they feel about their ranks. A was very happy about the results. He felt himself confident and ranking gives a sense of pride and superiority to him. E was very sad about the results and He felt down and sensed an inferiority in him. Thedal also asked A about results of E and vice versa. A felt sorry for E’s results and took a sense of pity on him, and that he will help him better next time. E looked at A’s success as something superior and he should look up to him and work for the next test. </p>

        <p> A ranking system that is direct outcome of how fifty students prepared and performed in a test, puts people in a certain grading and the emotions of people in different positions of the grade-system has a relative amounts of <i>superiority, inferiority, pity and reverence</i>. </p>

        <p> On the same day, in the afternoon, the Chemistry teacher conducted an objective test on Atoms and Molecules. All the fifty students in the class were waiting to write the exam. Everyone got a paper each that stated their marks obtained in their test and their rank from 1 to 50. </p>

        <p> One student named B got 100 out of 100 and ranked no. 1 in the class.<br>Another student named O got 18 out of 100 and ranked no. 50 in the class. </p>

        <p> The students were looking at each other confused. They felt violated when they have been randomly awarded marks and ranking without evaluating their skills and efforts through any questions. </p>

        <p> O was the first to stand up and questioned the Chemistry teacher. He told that, he felt cheated and angry by looking at being ranked 50 and he needs to be justified on what basis this was awarded to him. Then slowly one by one stood up and shared their thoughts on the same. Finally B stood up and he told he also felt blinded and guilty for being given No. 1 rank without any efforts randomly and he cannot enjoy the sense of success it presumed to give him which is mockery of the efforts and skills of everyone else. The Chemistry teacher apologized understanding his mistake and retracted the marks and ranks. </p>

        <p> A ranking system that is unscientific and not based on any means of justification to put people in a certain grading must eventually creates relative amounts of <i>guilt and anger</i>. </p>

        <p> The emotional outcomes such as <i>pride, inferiority, guilt, anger, pity or reverence</i> depends only on whether the grading system is scientific or unscientific. </p>
