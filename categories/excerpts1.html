    <p> Once there was a residential school in a city in which a boy named Thedal was studying in eighth standard. One day, his Physics teacher conducted an objective test on Electromagnetism. All the fifty students in the class wrote the exam and the teacher evaluated their answers and gave them marks and they were ranked from 1 to 50 based on their marks. Since this is their first test that they all are facing in this academic year, the students were really nervous to get to know their marks and ranking. </p>

    <p>I’m not trying to say that “RCB is raped by KKR” as quoted by any main-stream media, or at the least I am not aware of. But I have seen people keeps ‘rape’ as a usage connecting to a defeats in sports in social-media and in person as well. Also, I am not saying I am outraged by this usage but I wanted to think about the meaning behind this usage, thereby trying to understand the term ‘rape’ more also.</p>
