        <p> This post was in my Drafts section and running along in my minds for more than a year around which I‚Äôm trying to figure out on a whole how to put this out. I‚Äôm just compiling various things regarding this randomly. </p>

        <p> The idea of ‚ÄúGoing Green‚Äù is however fashionable and noble it may sound, It also always comes out from the position of privilege. Although I‚Äôm someone who used to commute regularly only in cycle for work and study upto 10 kms in my past few years. </p>

        <p> My usual pastime when waiting on traffic signals is to look at the people there and imagine them using other sustainable modes of transport instead of riding a car alone or bike. </p>

        <p> I used to see people cycling beside me as well commuting definitely in a much cheaper cycles and visibly could get that they don‚Äôt afford more than a cycle to commute. And You can never ask them taking pride in hashtags of #GoGreen or #Cycle2Commute and given a chance to own and use motor vehicles, their whole livelihood may even transform and they‚Äôll be always up for it too. </p>

        <p> So Now the question arises, Do they have obligation to ask for a greener world? Should there be any moral obligation to be put on anyone when they ask for a better earth? </p>

        <p> I was listening Dr. Michael Mann from Penn state University who works on Climate Change in Mindscape podcast, who questioned US having the highest per-capita carbon emissions per year, Can they ask the developing countries to stop going full-throttle development and cut down emissions after their President announcing that they won‚Äôt follow Paris Accord? </p>

        <p> One of my classmates, few days back asked me when I told him about me attending Global Climate Strike, ‚ÄúHave you ever planted a tree?‚Äù I of course have planted, But I didn‚Äôt tell him that instead asking, Why should that only make someone talk against Climate Change? </p>

        <p> Who can afford to want a better world to live in? Who can have the moral obligation to demand for a better environment? </p>

        <p> Can the local slum-dwellers near the banks of river or coastal areas, the encroachers of natural environment? And the occupants of lake-view and sea-view apartments have the better obligation to voice against their encroachment? Does that mean both are not encroachments and left as such? </p>

        <div id = "quote"> Our course on Climate-Change is deeply connected with our ways of utilization of the available natural resources. The opportunities of utilization of natural resources in our society is clearly restricted by class positions one enjoy in the society. </div>

        <p> Therefore the privilege to stop the exploitation on an individual level and putting the moral obligation of greener living to individuals is a misguided statement. </p>

        <p> Everyone has the same obligation to have a better world to live in. A better environment to leave it to the future to come back. </p>

        <p> So, Where does #GoGreen could stand? Only in the elitist statements? The ideas of sustainable future starts from the top to bottom with sensitizing through various groups at the ground levels and policies that aim at promoting alternatives on mass scale without increasing climate refugees than mere sloganeering. </p>

        <p> Let‚Äôs #GoGreen?? Or #GoThink more? ü§î </p>
