                          <p> <b>Premise:</b><br>
It has been years that I start learning terms in politics, social conversation throughout the life like, capitalism, feminism, casteism, Brahminism, etc. and almost always observed contradictions, misconceptions, and debates regarding the nomenclature behind these terms thus leading to misrepresentation of what it stands for. I try to explain here what I understood over the years as the logic as I perceive behind the naming and try my reasoning to justify it so. </p>

<p><b>First thoughts:</b><br>
To set things straight, I want to put out what the term is meant when it is used and then explain why so in later parts. When someone use the term <b>‘capitalism’</b> and say they are against capitalism, they mean to say they are against <b><em>class inequality</em></b>. When someone use the term <b>‘feminism’</b>, they mean to say <b><em>gender equality</em></b>. When someone use the term <b>‘brahminism’</b> and say they are against it, they mean to say they are against <b><em>caste inequality</em></b>. </p>
<p><b>Arguments:</b><br>
The usual and straightforward argument that arises over the time when such explanation is given itself, why not name it so itself. Why not call it straight forwardly as gender equality or caste inequality or class inequality. What is the point to use it as ‘femin’-ism, why only ‘brahmin’-ism, what is wrong with ‘capital’-ism?</p> 
<p><b>Few Distinctions:</b><br>
In all the conversation so far, there are two distinct problems being addressed which could be seen from the nomenclature itself. We are fighting against gender inequality, class inequality and caste inequality but also fighting for gender equality. Does that mean, we want class equality, does that mean we want caste equality too? No. The rational behind that is gender exists in the world as a natural scientific phenomenon (not as binary but a spectrum). Class and caste are artificial and unscientific and the movement that proposes to talk against caste and class inequality see the elimination of both caste and class structures as the end-goal.</p> 
<p>Hence, Long Live Gender Equality! Long Live Classless World! Long live Casteless World! is the absolute goal. But what is the rational then behind this naming? Every movement that calls for equality against any inequality or unscientific hierarchy or injustice, etc. should proceed also in addressing the root of the problem that it tries to solve. Hence the naming often always end up focusing on addressing the root of the problem. How?</p>
<p><b>Logics:</b><br>
Take class inequality, Karl Marx identifies the problem that a class structure exists in this reality is because of the creation of an idea called <b>‘capital’</b> out of surplus labour that sustains the structure. Hence the root of the problem is an idea of capital. So, the Marxists or Communists or Socialists whichever end goal they may have, their predominant aim is to root out this idea called ‘capital’. Hence when any human say they are against class inequality and class as a structure, they use the term ‘capitalism’ for it.</p>
<p>Take caste inequality, Ambedkar or Periyar or any other anti-caste activist try to look at the problem of caste as a structure of graded inequality that oppresses everyone in the structure in different grades. They tend to see the root is in the elimination of the caste as a structure and anyone who is at the top oppressor of a pyramid scheme kind of such a structure is the key in sustaining it. In Annihilation of caste, Ambedkar clearly puts forward the idea of brahmins as an intellectual class in the casteist society uses not only intellect but also divine sanctions through scriptures to justify and promote such structure. Does that mean, rest of the savarnas (kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras) are not exploiting? Of course, they do. But any attempt by anyone in that hierarchy in justifying and sustaining, getting benefitted out of caste structure are following the idea of <b>‘brahminism’</b>. Thus, the goal to eliminate the structure and means that sustain the structure eventually calls for terming the very idea of caste inequality as ‘brahminism’. When any human say they are against caste inequality and caste as a structure itself, they use the term ‘brahminism’ for it.</p>
<p>Take gender inequality or gender equality as we want to achieve, the root of the problem is in disenfranchisement of women in all spheres arising out of patriarchy in the society. Hence the movement that goes for idea of gender equality aims at the enfranchisement of the women and thus terming the very idea as ‘feminism’. Does that mean gender is binary? Does that mean queer has no space in gender equality? No, the movement however started identifying a world where gender was seen binary hence against patriarchy termed feminism. So, when any human say they are against patriarchy and support gender equality, they use the term <b>‘feminism’</b> for it.</p>
<p><b>Intersectionality:</b><br>
There exists multiple inequalities in the reality faced by every individual, and they face graded oppression and/or privileges in every structure as well. Hence a combined effect of these three structures give rise to a non-linear effect on the lifestyle of any individual which cannot be directly addressed as a simple structured problem. There comes intersections between structures. So, addressing problems in such complex manner is what we call intersectionality as I understand.</p>

<p><b>Final Remarks:</b><br>
Capitalism = Class inequality.<br>
Brahminism = Caste inequality.<br>
Feminism = Gender equality.</p>
