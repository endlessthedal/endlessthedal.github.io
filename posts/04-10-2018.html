        <p> Isn’t that amazing? </p>

        <p> There are only Green signals (or be it any of your one favourite colour) in a four way crossing.<br>Just ON and OFF.One after the other.<br>ON says Go.<br>OFF says Stop.<br>Isn’t it?<br>No?!! </p>

        <p> Why? </p>

        <p> I have often come across this situation when people hesitate to speak their minds in a group discussion. When enquired in person, they’ll have huge stories to tell, sometimes turn out to be better contributions as well. What they are afraid of most of the time is a criticism to their opinion from others at all. </p>

        <p> Even this attitude is visible in many public forums or some polls in Social media, where people are afraid to hold on to an opinion or say it out loud that this is the opinion that they have. The reason mostly is that they want to avoid some other’s opinions or criticism against their opinions. People understand that everyone has their own right and freedom to have their opinions on things, Yet are not constantly holding up for it unless they are confident of less criticism against them. </p>

        <p> It is highly equivalent to the mind-set when in a four way junction, We ride confidently not only when we get the green signal to go, But all other three ways get Red signals. </p>

        <p> What about people who speak trash and not worry others anytime at all?<br>What about people who rash drive without minding traffic signals at all? </p>

        <p> Does that mean, It is right that people are silent and speak only when others will not criticise, in the same way, when people wait for others to get red signal and then go? </p>

        <p> What purpose does red lights serve?<br>Should there be criticism at all among a group?<br>How should people with opinions cross roads with criticism? </p>

        <p> Questions.<br>Just questions… </p>
